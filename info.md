## Buddhism has 3 gems...

The Buddha is your inspiration. Becuase the Buddha was about to attain peace of mind, we have the confidence we can too.

The dharma, or teachings, used to be hard to find. But... with the advent of the internet you can find texts and talks so that you don't have to go to tibet.

The sangha, or the community. This is the tough one. Depending on where you live, you may not be able to find a sangha.
