## Buddhism has 3 gems...

<b>The Buddha</b> is your inspiration. Because the Buddha was albe to attain peace of mind, we have the confidence we can too.

<b>The Dharma</b>, or teachings, used to be hard to find. But... with the advent of the internet you can find texts and talks so that you don't have to go to tibet.

<b>The Sangha</b>, or the community. This is the tough one. Depending on where you live, you may not be able to find a sangha. It is to this problem that this site plans to address.
