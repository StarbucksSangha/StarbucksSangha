## Buddhism has 3 gems...

<b>The Buddha</b> is your inspiration. Because the Buddha was albe to attain peace of mind, we have the confidence we can too.

<b>The Dharma</b>, or teachings, used to be hard to find. But... with the advent of the internet you can find texts and talks so that you don't have to go to foreign lands to have access to the teachings. This site & it's tweets will provide you with links to both texts and talks so that you will have access to the dharma.

<b>The Sangha</b>, or the community. This is the tough one. Depending on where you live, you may not be able to find a sangha. It is to this problem that this site plans to address. We plan on using Starbucks locations to help you find other people in your area that may also be interested in the dharma.

More to come...
