## The three jewels...

<b>The Buddha</b> (awakened one) is an inspiration. Because he (SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama) was able to attain peace of mind, we have the confidence we can too.

<b>The Dharma</b> (teachings) used to be hard to find. With the advent of the internet you can now find [talks](https://www.dhammatalks.org/mp3_collections_index.html){:target="_blank"} and [texts](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/index.html){:target="_blank"} without traveling to far off lands, or even leaving your home.

<b>The Sangha</b> (community) can be more difficult. You may not have a traditional sangha near you, but virtually everyone has a Starbucks near them. Why not use your local Starbucks as your sangha?

More to come...
