## Buddhism has 3 gems...

<b>The Buddha</b> is our inspiration. Because the Buddha was able to attain peace of mind, we have the confidence we can too.

<b>The Dharma</b>, or teachings, used to be hard to find. But with the advent of the internet you can now find [talks](https://www.dhammatalks.org/mp3_collections_index.html){:target="_blank"} and [texts](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/index.html){:target="_blank"} without having to go to foreign lands. This site & it's tweets will provide you with links to plenty of talks and texts.

<b>The Sangha</b>, or the community, is the tough one. You may not be able to find a sangha near you, but you do have a Starbucks near you right? Since virtually everyone on earth has a Starbucks near them, the idea is to get you to think of Starbucks as your sangha, and thus is born... StarbucksSangha.NET.
